***Design and set up***  
Your set up looks great! As you mentioned, there are plenty of resources, so you should be able to get up and running fairly quickly.

***Regarding model complexity***  
A model can be simple or complex regardless of the amount of variables that you include. You can engineer, and use, very complex models to describe the prices, or you can use a simple linear regression of just a few values. The best model is the one that works best for the problem and the type solution you are looking for!

**Questions:**  

* What type of model do you think you will use?
* What type of preprocessing do you need to perform?
* What other data *could* (though you won't) you include? This is often a question that peoeple will ask in the real world.

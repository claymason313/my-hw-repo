### ***Final Project Feedback***

***Nico Van de Bovenkamp***

**Overall**  
Nice work on the data manipulation and plotting! You got a lot out of your pandas digging through all that data. I am sure that took a bit, and you learned a lot. Steadily on your way to the next steps -- building your model!

**Recommendations**  

***Plotting***  
While groupbys and sums are really nice, it can seriously help to seem some plots. Even just simple bins/histograms can be helpful. It can be time consuming, but when it comes time to really get some insight, plots help for intuition. Not to mention plots are key in presentations. I suggest you pick a couple key groupbys and plot them out!

***Extracting features***  
You have done some of this already, but the next thing you are going to want to do is extract some features. Maybe it's a groupby or imputing the mean per-product, or other aggregations, doing some data transforms (log, exponentiate, standard scaling, etc.), one-hot-encoding your categoricals, etc.

These are truly the next steps before you can build your model. Once you have a good feature set, you can then start experimenting with different regressors!

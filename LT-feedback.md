***Project 1: Hedgefunds***  
As you mentioned, this one will be difficult to 1) practically accomplish and 2) be able to model. There are tons of exogenous factors that will come into play, so I don't think this will be the best project to focus on.   


***Project 2: Big Mart***  
This is a great one! Plenty of resources online, and, if you are ultimately interested in time series modeling, this is a great project to go with.  


***Project 3: Student Success***  
Solid dataset, and an interesting project. This is definitely a good one that is well structured, though there is not a ton of data. You may be limited in the models you can apply, but still this is a great dataset to work on.

    "Answer: The results were conclusive in that the prestige of the undergraduate program is statistically significant. If there is more data available aside from GRE, GPA, and undergraduate prestige, then it would be ideal to see if there are other factors that may have influenced the admittance statistics. Examples of other factors that could be explored could include demographics, location of undergraduate schools, previous work experience, etc. "
